<p>In this economic-historical online archive, authentic historical
sources from the beginning of the 20th century until currently circa
1949 are made available to you via the web.</p>
<p>The editorial team has taken great pains to identify the authors of
the historical material considered for online publication. Insofar as
authors could be identified and their deaths occurred less than seventy
years ago, access to individual documents is blocked until the copyright
protection period expires. We ask for your understanding in this
matter.</p>
<p>This service and the digitization that precedes it are funded by the
DFG and the Leibniz Association. It is a purely scientific project.
There is no commercial exploitation on the part of the ZBW, i.e. access
to the individual documents is free of charge.</p>
<p>The data offered are generally uncommented and have not yet been
catalogued by archivists. We do not guarantee that the information
contained therein is factually correct.</p>
<p>Older texts, especially from the Nazi period, may contain fascist,
racist or sexist tendencies. The ZBW as a scientific service institution
documents these texts in the context of the collection, but distances
itself from such content. Recognizably illegal texts, images, links,
etc. have not been included.</p>
<p>Editors or authors who wish to claim the non-expiry of copyright
periods or other obstacles, which bar these documents or links from
being put online, are expressly encouraged to contact the ZBW by
whatever means, but most easily via the following e-mail address:
<a href='mai&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;pr&#37;65sse&#109;a&#112;p%65%3&#50;&#48;&#64;&#122;b%7&#55;-onlin&#101;&#46;e&#117;?subject=Legal'>pressemappe20@zbw-online.eu</a></p>
<p><a name="eu"></p>
<p>The digitized microfilms (up to 1949) are published in the legal area
of the European Union with reference to §61d UrhG (use of
out-of-commerce works by cultural heritage institutions) in conjunction
with §1,2 NvWV (German complementary regulation for the use of
out-of-commerce works). The archival units published here (digitized
microfilms) are listed in the EUIPO portal of the EU. Rights holders of
individual works can object to publication there or at the above e-mail
address. In doing so, we kindly ask for the exact specification of the
respective work (via web address/URL) for which the copyright is
claimed.</p>
<p>Any use of the offered documents or parts thereof is the
responsibility of the users. They are responsible for compliance with
copyright or other provisions of the legal system applicable to
them.</p>
<p>Any brands (trademarks), work titles, company designations,
designations of origin, registered designs, patents or utility models
are mentioned without any special reference to such rights. Therefore,
the absence of such a reference does not imply that the designation in
question is free of such or similar rights. This applies in particular
to historical designations, which may continue to exist even though
their historical owner has since ceased to exist.</p>
