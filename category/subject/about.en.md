### Hamburgisches Welt-Wirtschafts-Archiv (HWWA)
# Folders by Subject Category System




In total 1396 categories, 9204 folders.

Of the PM20 Länder-/Sacharchiv up to 1949, only a rough estimate of one-fifth
of the digitized holdings are indexed in folders and accessible via this
category system. Many small and large countries such as Great Britain,
China, India, France or the USA are missing at all or are only represented by a
few folders originating from the "Forschungsstelle für das Übersee-Deutschtum".

All unprocessed material is accessible under [digitized
films](/film/h1_sh.de.html) (in German), including material from the [second
filming (until 1960)](/film/h2_sh.de.html) - for copyright reasons, however,
unfortunately only in the ZBW reading room. The [complete subject category
system](https://pm20.zbw.eu/report/pm20_result.de.html?jsonFile=vocab/subject_by_signature.en.json&main_title=Subject+category+system)
is available online.
